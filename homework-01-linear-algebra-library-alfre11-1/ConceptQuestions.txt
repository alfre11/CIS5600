The vec4 operator*(const vec4 &v) const declaration is used for multiplication of a matrix by a vector (column vector). The vec4 operator*(const vec4 &v, const mat4 &m) declaration is used for multiplying a vector (row vector) by a matrix. The first const in the first operator denotes the reference as constant, so the variable being referenced cannot be changed. The final const in the first operator declares the function as const, meaning it does not modify any of the member variables and can be called on constant objects. The two consts in the second operator are also declaring constant references, preventing the referenced values from being changed.

The first declaration returns just the value of the parameter (and uses const), so the original objectâ€™s value cannot be changed. This would be used when you want to take the value of an object but do not want to change the value of the original. For example, if you had a function that outputs the sum of 2 vectors and you do not want to change the original parameters. The second declaration returns a reference to the value as the specified index. When this value is changed, the value of the original will be changed as well. This could be used, for example, when you want to scale a vector, changing the original vector object.
